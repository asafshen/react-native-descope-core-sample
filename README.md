## React Native Sample with Descope Core JS SDK
Simple usage of Descope [core-js-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@descope/core-js-sdk)

## Pre-requisites
- Env for running React native app (I used XCode for macOS)
- Descope project (You can create it in https://app.descope.com/)

## Quick Start
- `npm i`
- to to `App.js` and Replace project ID and email as you wish
```
const PROJECT_ID = '<project-id>';
const EMAIL = '<email>';
```
- for mac - `npm run ios` 
- click `Press to login` button

(you will then see your one time code in your email)

### Notes 
- this app was built using `create-expo-app`. see [RN docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=quickstart)
- see more Descope core js usage in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/descope/descope-js/tree/main/packages/core-js-sdk)
